						<p class="quotes">"People are constantly taking selfies. I
								don’t like taking selfies – it seems very
								frustrating to me to fit myself into a
								particular instant and state, into an image I
								like.
								Here, the role of the photographer is very
								important and I certainly didn’t expect this
								would be me.
								Taking a selfie and, what’s more, when you’re sad and crying, is, to my mind,
								like pulling a trigger in your face – people wouldn’t take photos of themselves at
								such moments.
								• When I went in, I was shocked-saddened-broke into tears, and then I
								instinctively started arranging my hair, trying to make myself look good for a
								selfie… Then I gave up and simply took a shot. This made me think about
								how many moments remain unappreciated, even the sad ones, even the
								black-and-white ones… A black box with emotions… They rarely come out
								in the open, only when the plane crashes. At the same time, you are faced
								with portraits of another person who may have felt the same way, and you
								realize you aren’t alone, this gives you courage to press the button and, “To
								hell with it!”, to take a photo of yourself even with tears in the eyes."
